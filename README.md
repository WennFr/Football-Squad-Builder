# Football Squad Builder In Progress!

## üìÉDescription
This is a work in progress application where you can build your own custom lineups. It utilizes a third party API to retreive competition, club and player data and stores it in a local DB. The UI is a web app with a graphical football field and a list of
players where you can start constructing your own lineups by sorting players by competitions and clubs and dragging them on to the pitch.


## :computer: Usage
When running the .NET Web API for the first time, the application will automatically check the database for existing content and retrieve data for the local database if none is found.
After this process is done and the API is running on your localhost, the react project is ready to be launched by running the command "npm run dev" in the react terminal.


## üõ†Ô∏è Implementations
Football Squad Builder is a headless project built with React Vite and .NET, utilizing TypeScript for the front end, and a .NET Web API for the backend.
